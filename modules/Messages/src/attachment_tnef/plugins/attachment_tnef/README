Plugin was originally written for SquirrelMail webmail interface by Bernd 
Wiegmann <bernd@wib-software.de> and Graham Norbury <gnorbury@bondcar.com>. 
This plugin version is rewritten for use in NaSMail webmail interface. It is
maintained by the NaSMail project developers.

Description
-----------
This plugin allows to open and extract embedded attachments from ms-tnef encoded
files such as "winmail.dat".  (As generated by Microsoft Outlook and friends)

With this plugin enabled, an extra "view" option will be added to the available
hyperlinks whenever a file of mime-type 'application/ms-tnef' is received. After
selecting this link, you will be taken to a page displaying the contents of the
file, and given the opportunity to download one or more of the attachments.

To Do
-----
* Add missing vcard attributes.
* Generate/download vcards and import them into address book.
* Check for other unsupported part types.
* Inline view of text and image parts.
* Don't store large parts in object.
