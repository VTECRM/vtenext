# Why we do that?
Nowadays, many companies are spending a <img src="https://www.vtenext.com/images/graphs.png" data-canonical-src="https://www.vtenext.com/images/graphs.png" width="350" height="190" align="right">
lot of money in solutions that are not able to
fix the real customer relationship problems
because they are too complicated, there are
too dashboards and procedures to know.
What’s the outcome? People give up the
application and come back to work in the old
style: mail and spreadsheets.
We want to do their job easily and make CRM
projects more effective, so VTENEXT was born.

 # VTE Revolution
<p align="left"> We strongly believe that CRM systems are very important to improve business company,
better managing customer relationships and increasing effciency.<br><br>
However, to implement a real CRM strategy within a company it is imperative that the CRM
is integrated into the various business areas and organized in processes.<br><br><br>
We have therefore decided to implement a <img src="https://www.vtenext.com/images/ProcessMaker.png" data-canonical-src="https://www.vtenext.com/images/ProcessMaker.png" width="350" height="190" align="right">
<b>BPM software engine</b>. This is a system that
allows to mapping business processes and
managing them through a tasks system.
You can also develop SDK custom function
on them to implement strange and
particular situations. </p>
